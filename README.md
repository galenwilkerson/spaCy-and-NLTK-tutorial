# Quick Tutorial on Using spaCy and NLTK for Text Processing

## Overview

This notebook provides an introduction to text processing using spaCy and NLTK, two popular Python libraries for Natural Language Processing (NLP). It demonstrates how to use these libraries for tasks like tokenization, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity recognition (NER), and more. The tutorial is designed to show how these tools can complement Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 for more effective text processing.

## Content Outline

### 1. Preprocessing Text Data with NLTK and spaCy
- **Tokenization:** Breaking text into words, sentences, or subwords.
- **Stopword Removal:** Filtering out common words that don't add significant meaning.
- **Lemmatization and Stemming:** Reducing words to their base forms.
- **POS Tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Understanding sentence structure and identifying key entities.

### 2. Augmenting LLM Outputs
- **NER and Entity Linking:** Enriching generated text with additional context.
- **Syntactic Analysis:** Ensuring syntactic correctness.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Assessing the sentiment of generated text.

### 3. Building Custom Pipelines
- **Custom Entity Recognition:** Tailoring NER models for specific domains.
- **Text Normalization:** Standardizing text for consistency.
- **Data Alignment and Translation:** Preparing multilingual data for training LLMs.

### 4. Visualization and Debugging
- **Parse Trees and Dependency Structures:** Visualizing syntactic structures.
- **Frequency Distributions and Word Clouds:** Understanding model focus and coverage.

### 5. Training and Fine-Tuning LLMs
- **Corpus Preparation:** Creating and annotating corpora.
- **Language Modeling:** Using n-grams for foundational insights in LLM training.

### 6. Post-Processing and Validation
- **Consistency Checking:** Ensuring generated text consistency.
- **Entity Consistency and Validation:** Verifying accuracy across documents.

### Top 20 Features of spaCy
- **Installation and Model Loading:** Setting up and loading spaCy models.
- **Tokenization, POS Tagging, NER:** Core text processing tasks.

- **Custom Named Entity Recognition and Pipelines:** Extending spaCy’s capabilities.
- **Visualization and Exporting Models:** Visualizing and saving models.

### Top 20 Features of NLTK
- **Installation and Tokenization:** Setting up NLTK and basic text processing.
- **Stopwords Removal, Stemming, Lemmatization:** Core preprocessing steps.
- **POS Tagging, NER, Synonyms and Antonyms:** Advanced linguistic analysis.
- **Frequency Distribution, Concordance:** Analyzing text content.
- **Parsing, N-Grams, Text Classification:** Building and understanding models.
- **Sentiment Analysis, Corpora, WordNet:** In-depth text analysis tools.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `spaCy` and its models (`en_core_web_sm`)
- `NLTK` and its datasets

### Installation

```bash
pip install spacy
pip install nltk
